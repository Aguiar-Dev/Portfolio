## Introduction

This project is a Overview of the basic usage of SASS and how to implement it. The purpose of this project is to gain experience in SASS and its multiple uses. Throughout the documentation you will find basics on SASS and examples on how to use it. Included in this research is also a custom project that I implemented using only HTML5, CSS3, and SASS in order to test out the material that I research. I will add instructions on how to clone the repository to view the example webpage.

At the end of the documentation you can find all the resources used for this research project and any tools that were used with SASS. Like always I utilize redacted information from multiple websites and articles so I will try my best to document these in the Resources section of the documentation. Thanks for taking the time to view my SASS Research project, hope you enjoyed it and learned something new.

## What is SASS?

SASS, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, is a CSS preprocessor which allows developers to write stylesheets in a more convenient way and then compiles it into CSS. SASS allows developers to use features such as variables, nesting, functions, and more allowing faster creation and modularity in stylesheets. With SASS stylesheet creation is faster, more organized, and more modular than vanilla CSS.

It was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum, then continued as SassScript by Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein. Because of this Sass consists of two different syntaxes, the original '.sass' which used indentation to separate code blocks and newline chars to separate rules. Then there is the new and most commonly used syntax '.scss', which uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a code block.
