## Introduction

This project is a Overview of the basic usage of SASS and how to implement it. The purpose of this project is to gain experience in SASS and its multiple uses. Throughout the documentation you will find basics on SASS and examples on how to use it. Included in this research is also a custom project that I implemented using only HTML5, CSS3, and SASS in order to test out the material that I research. I will add instructions on how to clone the repository to view the example webpage.

At the end of the documentation you can find all the resources used for this research project and any tools that were used with SASS. Like always I utilize redacted information from multiple websites and articles so I will try my best to document these in the Resources section of the documentation. Thanks for taking the time to view my SASS Research project, hope you enjoyed it and learned something new.
