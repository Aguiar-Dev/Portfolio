## Key Vocabulary Terms

These terms are used in various Agile frameworks and are crucial to learn when undertaking an Agile approach in a project or task. Most of these terms or practices are used in all Agile frameworks, but some are specific to one framework. Once they are learned you are a step closer to being a professional Agile Developer.

- **Agile Software Management -** The project management approach of developing increments of software in frequent iterations based on evolving requirements.

- **Backlog -** Is a changing list of product requirements based on the customerâ€™s needs. The backlog is not to be confused with a To-Do list, rather a list of desired features.

- **Burndown Chart -** A burndown chart represents all outstanding work, where the vertical axis represents the backlog, while the horizontal axis represents time. Burndown charts are used to measure the progress of an agile project at both a iteration and project level. The work remaining can be represented by story points, ideal days, team days, or other metrics.

- **Daily Standup/Meeting -** is a key component of Agile methodologies and serves as a daily forum for Agile teams to share progress, report impediments, and make commitments for the current iteration or sprint. This brief, 15-minute meeting is usually held every morning at the same time and in the same location.

- **Epic -** A very large user story that, in their current state, would be difficult to estimate or to complete in a single iteration. They are typically lower priority and are waiting to be broken down into smaller stories.

- **Fail-Fast -** Is the process of starting work on a task or project, obtaining immediate feedback, and then whether to continue working on the task or take a different approach - that is, adapt.

- **Iteration -** Is a fixed or timeboxed period of time, generally spanning two to four weeks, during which an Agile team develops a deliverable, potentially shippable product.

- **Kanban -** Is a highly visual framework that uses continuous workflow rather than fixed iterations to produce shippable deliverables. Kanban focuses on completing entire projects rather than sprints.

- **Planning Poker -** Also called scrum poker, is a team-building and consensus-based exercise or game used for estimating workloads.

- **Product Owner -** Represents the voice of the customer and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The product Owner writes the acceptance criteria, prioritizes them, and then adds them to the product backlog. Scrums teams typically have one Product Owner.

- **Scrum -** Is a popular framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is based on the adaptive and iterative methodology of software development that follows a set of predefined roles, responsibilities and meetings.

- **Scrum Master -** Is not the team leader but is often viewed as the team coach who acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended, they have no authority over teammates, but due have complete authority over the process. A key part of their role is to protect the team and keep them focused on the tasks at hand.

- **Sprint -** A sprint is fixed-length iterations during which one user story or product backlog item (PBI) is transformed into a potentially shippable deliverable. Each sprint is assigned a set amount of time to be accomplished, which is usually between one week to one month.

- **Stakeholder -** Loosely refers to anyone outside the Scrum Team who has an interest in the product that the team is producing. Stakeholders can include but are not limited to direct managers, subject matter experts, account managers, salespeople, and legal officers.

- **Story Points -** Non-unit of estimation measuring complexity and size. Story points are relative, not absolute, and do not relate to actual hours.

- **Task -** Is a single unit of work broken down from a user story. Tasks are estimated in hours (or story points) remaining by the developer working on them.

- **Task Board -** An Agile task board is a physical or online visual representation of user stories broken down into tasks or work units.

- **Technical Debt -** Refers to the obligation a development team incurs when they use a short-term, expedient approach to developing software package without considering the long-term consequences. It increases project costs and complexity due to issues introduced through the software package.

- **Test Driven Development (TDD) -** TDD is the practice of designing and building tests for functional, working code, and then building code that will pass those tests.

- **User Stories -** A user story is a very high-level definition of a requirement written from the end-users point of view, containing just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it.

- **Velocity -** It is a relative number which describes how much work the team can get done per sprint.
