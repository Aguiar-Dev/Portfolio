## Introduction

Welcome to the Overview on Agile Development, where most of the confusing and daunting information on Agile Development is made easier to understand. This overview is meant to explain the Agile Movement as a whole and showcase some of the best information on the web regarding Agile. In here you can find the best practices, vocabulary terms, popular methods and more on the Agile Movement. In order to best explain Agile I am utilizing multiple sources to collect and redact the most important information, all of these sources can be found in the [Resources Section](#resources).

This overview is both a personal and professional project that I undertook in order to better inform both you, the reader, and myself on what Agile is and does. It is not as detailed as other articles or websites, but I tried to make it as informative and helpful as possible. Please keep that in mind whilst going through the information. Thanks for taking the time to read through my overview I hope it helps you better understand the amazing principles of Agile Development.

## What is the Agile Process?

***"Agile is not just a methodology, but a set of principles and philosophy" - Pearl Zhu***

Many of the Agile Movement ideas surfaced around the 1970s as a reaction to traditional approaches to project development. But the Agile Development Movement was first introduced to the world in February 2001, when a group of 17 software developers met in Utah to discuss lightweight development methods. Together the seventeen published the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*, in which they shared their combined experiences of software developing and helping others to do it.

The Agile Process is in turn a collection of principles and methodologies based on iterative software development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration. While the Agile Process is to be considered as the fundamental principle behind the Agile movement, there are different ways to practice these principles and turn them to concrete examples, some of these are widely popular like Scrum and Kanban, while others are less known like XP and Lean.

To set the pace for this overview just remember ***Agile is not a Methodology!*** rather it is a movement that seeks alternative project management approaches to help teams to help teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences and empirical feedback. Now you probably want to know what are the benefits and whether or not it is for you?

## The Agile Benefits

Let's be honest, we all wanna know what makes Agile so enticing? Is it the fact that so many people use it? Is it because you won't need to do Waterfall anymore? Or is it simply because it sounds cool?

All of those are part of the answer, but in truth there's a lot of reasons as to why Agile is enticing and beneficial to individuals and teams. Let's shed some light on the most important benefits of Agile Development:

- *Better decision making through regular team meetings and project direction.*

- *Cost reductions by keeping both the team and stakeholders up to date, which reduces risks of unsatisfied customers and additional work.*

- *Transparency between team members, stakeholders, project managers, and all other involved parties.*

- *Preparedness for unknown variables by focusing on smaller tasks instead of bigger ones.*

- *Safer revisions by maintaining regular project meetings and realizing tests through every iteration.*

- *Increases overall team satisfaction by splitting projects into smaller tasks which in turn reduce misunderstandings, potential impediments and stressful deadline scenarios.*

- *Promotes a team environment through which members get to know each others strengths and weaknesses in order to overcome them together.*

These are a few of the more important benefits, but the list of benefits is much longer than this. Now that we covered those, you are probably wondering whether it's for you or not?

## Is Agile for You?

Figuring out whether the Agile Method is for you can be difficult, if not daunting at times. But that is what I am here to do, help you figure out whether or not it is for you. Let's start by jotting down who uses it and who doesn't, then from that you can decide whether it is appropriate for your project or not.

**Who uses Agile?**






<a name="vocabTerms"></a>
## Terms-to-Know

These terms are used in various Agile frameworks and are crucial to learn when undertaking an Agile approach in a project or task. Most of these terms or practices are used in all Agile frameworks, but some are specific to one framework. Once they are learned you are a step closer to being a professional Agile Developer.

- **Agile Software Management -** The project management approach of developing increments of software in frequent iterations based on evolving requirements.

- **Backlog -** Is a changing list of product requirements based on the customerâ€™s needs. The backlog is not to be confused with a To-Do list, rather a list of desired features.

- **Burndown Chart -** A burndown chart represents all outstanding work, where the vertical axis represents the backlog, while the horizontal axis represents time. Burndown charts are used to measure the progress of an agile project at both a iteration and project level. The work remaining can be represented by story points, ideal days, team days, or other metrics.

- **Daily Standup/Meeting -** is a key component of Agile methodologies and serves as a daily forum for Agile teams to share progress, report impediments, and make commitments for the current iteration or sprint. This brief, 15-minute meeting is usually held every morning at the same time and in the same location.

- **Epic -** A very large user story that, in their current state, would be difficult to estimate or to complete in a single iteration. They are typically lower priority and are waiting to be broken down into smaller stories.

- **Fail-Fast -** Is the process of starting work on a task or project, obtaining immediate feedback, and then whether to continue working on the task or take a different approach - that is, adapt.

- **Iteration -** Is a fixed or timeboxed period of time, generally spanning two to four weeks, during which an Agile team develops a deliverable, potentially shippable product.

- **Kanban -** Is a highly visual framework that uses continuous workflow rather than fixed iterations to produce shippable deliverables. Kanban focuses on completing entire projects rather than sprints.

- **Planning Poker -** Also called scrum poker, is a team-building and consensus-based exercise or game used for estimating workloads.

- **Product Owner -** Represents the voice of the customer and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The product Owner writes the acceptance criteria, prioritizes them, and then adds them to the product backlog. Scrums teams typically have one Product Owner.

- **Scrum -** Is a popular framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is based on the adaptive and iterative methodology of software development that follows a set of predefined roles, responsibilities and meetings.

- **Scrum Master -** Is not the team leader but is often viewed as the team coach who acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended, they have no authority over teammates, but due have complete authority over the process. A key part of their role is to protect the team and keep them focused on the tasks at hand.

- **Sprint -** A sprint is fixed-length iterations during which one user story or product backlog item (PBI) is transformed into a potentially shippable deliverable. Each sprint is assigned a set amount of time to be accomplished, which is usually between one week to one month.

- **Stakeholder -** Loosely refers to anyone outside the Scrum Team who has an interest in the product that the team is producing. Stakeholders can include but are not limited to direct managers, subject matter experts, account managers, salespeople, and legal officers.

- **Story Points -** Non-unit of estimation measuring complexity and size. Story points are relative, not absolute, and do not relate to actual hours.

- **Task -** Is a single unit of work broken down from a user story. Tasks are estimated in hours (or story points) remaining by the developer working on them.

- **Task Board -** An Agile task board is a physical or online visual representation of user stories broken down into tasks or work units.

- **Technical Debt -** Refers to the obligation a development team incurs when they use a short-term, expedient approach to developing software package without considering the long-term consequences. It increases project costs and complexity due to issues introduced through the software package.

- **Test Driven Development (TDD) -** TDD is the practice of designing and building tests for functional, working code, and then building code that will pass those tests.

- **User Stories -** A user story is a very high-level definition of a requirement written from the end-users point of view, containing just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it.

- **Velocity -** It is a relative number which describes how much work the team can get done per sprint.
