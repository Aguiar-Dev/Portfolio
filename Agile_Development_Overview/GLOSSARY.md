## A

**Agilista -** A practitioner of Agile Software Development who is fanatical about hewing to the Agile Manifesto.

**Agile Software Management -** The project management approach of developing increments of software in frequent *[iterations](#iterations)* based on evolving requirements.

<a name="acceptanceCriteria"></a>
**Acceptance Criteria -** These are specific criteria identified by the customer for each functional requirement. The acceptance criteria are written in simple terms and from a perspective of the customer. All acceptance criteria must be met for a story or feature to be considered complete.

<a name="acceptanceTest"></a>
**Acceptance Test -** Is a validation activity conducted to determine whether or not a story or feature satisfies its acceptance criteria. It is the last phase of the software testing process.

**Agile Manifesto -** Includes four values and 12 principles of an iterative software development process. It was developed by 17 software developers in February 2001, who were discussing lightweight development methods.

**Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) -** Is a continuous process of managing a software application from its initial planning to its retirement.

<a name="b"></a>
## B

**Backlog -** Is a changing list of product requirements based on the customer’s needs. The backlog is not to be confused with a To-Do list, rather a list of desired features.

**Backlog Grooming -** Occurs at the end of a *[sprint](#sprint)*, when the team meets to make sure the backlog is ready for the next sprint. The team may remove user stories that aren’t relevant, create new stories, reassess priority, or split user stories into smaller *[tasks](#t)*. It is both an ongoing process and the name for the meeting where this action occurs.

**Big Visible Charts -** Are large charts displayed near the Agile team that show how the team is progressing. You could make a big visible chart to show defects, *[velocity](#v)*, customer *[acceptance tests](#acceptanceTest)*, or to find out how much time the team is wasting.

**Behavior Driven Development (BDD) -** An agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behavior through discussion with stakeholder. It extends *[TDD](#tdd)* by writing cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.

**Bottleneck -** Is a sort of congestion in a system that occurs when workload arrives at a given point more quickly than that point can handle it.

<a name="bugs"></a>
**Bugs -** A software bug is a problem causing a program to crash or produce invalid output. It is caused by insufficient or erroneous logic and can be an error, mistake, defect or fault.

**Burndown Chart -** A burndown chart represents all outstanding work, where the vertical axis represents the backlog, while the horizontal axis represents time. Burndown charts are used to measure the progress of an agile project at both a *[iteration](#iterations)* and project level. The work remaining can be represented by *[story points](#storyPoints)*, ideal days, team days, or other metrics.

**Burnup Chart -** A burnup chart tracks how much work has been completed. There are two lines on the chart - one line represents total work and the other represents for completed. The vertical axis represents the amount of work measure in *[tasks](#t)*, hours or *[story points](#storyPoints)*, while the horizontal axis represents time, usually measured in days.

<a name="c"></a>
## C

**Cadence -** Describes the flow or the rhythm of events or *[tasks](#t)* in a project. It establishes a pattern that the team can follow to understand what they are doing and when it will be completed.

**Capacity -** Represents the amount of work that can be completed within a certain time frame and is based on the number of hours that an individual or team will be available to complete the work.

<a name="chicken"></a>
**Chickens -** Most often used in *[Scrum](#s)*, a “Chicken” refers to someone who is involved in the project, but is not accountable for any specific deliverable (such as a *[stakeholders](#stakeholder)* or manager).

**Continous Improvement -** Is a process of improving quality and efficiency by making small, incremental changes over time. In *[Kanban](#k)*, continuous improvement refers specifically to the process of optimizing workflow and reducing cycle time, which results in increased productivity.

**Continous Integration -** Is a software engineering practice that involves continual integration of new development code into the existing codebase.

**Cycle -** Refers to the total amount of time it takes for a single *[task](#t)* or work item to travel through the workflow from the beginning of work until it ships.

<a name="d"></a>
## D

**Daily Scrum -** is a brief communication and status-check session facilitated by the *[Scrum Master](#scrumMaster)* where *[Scrum Teams](#scrumTeam)* share progress, report *[impediments](#i)*, and make commitments for the current *[iteration](#iterations)* or *[sprint](#sprint)*. The Daily Scrum consists of a tightly focused conversation kept to a strict timeframe; the meeting is held at the same time, every day (ideally, in the morning), and in the same location.

**Daily Standup/Meeting -** is a key component of Agile methodologies and serves as a daily forum for Agile teams to share progress, report *[impediments](#i)*, and make commitments for the current *[iteration](#iterations)* or *[sprint](#sprint)*. This brief, 15-minute meeting is usually held every morning at the same time and in the same location.

**Done -** Also referred to as “Done Done”, this term is used to describe all the various *[tasks](#t)* that need to happen before a story is considered done. Teams usually create  the checklist of tasks.

<a name="e"></a>
## E

**Epic -** A very large *[user story](#userStory)* that, in their current state, would be difficult to estimate or to complete in a single *[iteration](#iterations)*. They are typically lower priority and are waiting to be broken down into smaller stories.

<a name="estimation"></a>
**Estimation -** The process of assigning a quantifiable measurement for the amount of workload needed to complete a project or *[task](#t)*, in order to determine the requirements to complete the project or task.

<a name="f"></a>
## F

**Fail-Fast -** Is the process of starting work on a *[task](#t)* or project, obtaining immediate feedback, and then whether to continue working on the task or take a different approach - that is, adapt.

**Feature Creep -** Is the tendency to add additional requirements or features to a project after development is already underway, it can occur on either a project or *[sprint](#sprint)* level.

**Fibonacci Sequence -** The Fibonacci Sequence is a mathematical sequence in which each subsequent number is determined by the sum of the two previous numbers. Teams often use this sequence when playing the game of Planning Poker to estimate the workload.

<a name="i"></a>
## I

**Impediment -** Is any obstacle that prevents an individual or team from completing a *[task](#t)* or project. Teams usually create a list of possible impediments called an Impediment Backlog and display this list where the team meets for *[Daily Scrums](#d)*.

<a name="iterations"></a>
**Iteration -** Is a fixed or *[timeboxed](#timebox)* period of time, generally spanning two to four weeks, during which an Agile team develops a deliverable, potentially shippable product.

**Iterative Development -** Is the process of breaking down projects into more manageable components known as iterations.

<a name="k"></a>
## K

**Kanban -** Is a highly visual framework that uses continuous workflow rather than fixed iterations to produce shippable deliverables. Kanban focuses on completing entire projects rather than *[sprints](#sprint)*.

<a name="l"></a>
## L

**Lean Software Development (LSD) -** Is an example of lightweight Agile methodology applied to project development. It combines the Lean manufacturing approach pioneered by Toyota in the 1950s and Lean IT principles, and applies them to software. LSD places a strong emphasis on people and effective communication. It is defined by seven principles: Eliminate Waste, Create Knowledge, Build Quality In, Defer commitment, Optimize the Whole, Deliver Fast, Respect People.

<a name="p"></a>
## P

**Pair Programming -** Is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One types in code while the other reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The person typing is called the driver. The person reviewing the code is called the observer (or navigator). The two programmers switch roles frequently.

**Pigs -** Like “*[Chicken](#chicken)*” it is used most commonly in *[Scrum](#s)*, but unlike “Chickens” a “Pig” is someone who is committed and directly accountable for deliverables.

**Planning Game -** Refers to a planning meeting held to decide which user stories to include in the next *[iteration](#iterations)* or *[releases](#release)*.

<a name="planningPoker"></a>
**Planning Poker -** Also called scrum poker, is a team-building and consensus-based exercise or game used for estimating workloads.

<a name="productBacklog"></a>
**Product Backlog -** Acts as a repository for requirements targeted for *[releases](#release)* at some point. These are typically high level requirements with high level estimates provided by the product *[stakeholders](#stakeholder)*. The requirements are listed on the backlog in priority order and maintained by the product owner. It is not to be considered as a To-Do list, rather a list of customer requested features.

<a name="pbi"></a>
**Product Backlog Item (PBI) -** Is a single element of work that exists in the product backlog. PBIs can include user stories, *[epics](#e)*, specs, *[bugs](#bugs)*, or change requirements. The product owner is in charge of compiling and prioritizing the product backlog and placing the most important PBIs at the top.

<a name="productOwner"></a>
**Product Owner -** Represents the voice of the customer and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business. The product Owner writes the *[acceptance criteria](#acceptanceCriteria)*, prioritizes them, and then adds them to the product backlog. Scrums teams typically have one Product Owner.

<a name="r"></a>
## R

**Refactoring -** Refactoring code means to improve, clarify, and streamline the internal structure of existing code without affecting its external behavior. Refactoring does not include rewriting code or fixing *[bugs](#bugs)*.

**Relative Estimation -** Is one of several types of estimations Agile teams use to determine the amount of effort needed to complete project *[tasks](#t)*. Tasks or user stories are compared against equivalent, previously completed tasks or group of tasks of similar difficulty.

<a name="release"></a>
**Release -** An Agile release refers to the final delivery of a software package after the completion of multiple *[iterations](#iterations)* or *[sprints](#sprint)*. A release can be either the initial build of an application or the addition of one or more features to an existing application.

**Release Plan -** Outlines the features to be included in an upcoming release and provides an estimated date for the release. The plan should include responsibilities, resources, and activities required to complete the release.

<a name="s"></a>
## S

**Scrum -** Is a popular framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is based on the adaptive and iterative methodology of software development that follows a set of predefined roles, responsibilities and meetings.

<a name="scrumTeam"></a>
**Scrum Team -** Is responsible for delivering the product. A Team is typically made up of 5-9 people with cross-functional skills who do the actual work (analyze, design, develop, test, technical communication, document, etc.) It is recommended that the team be self-organizing and self-led, but often work with some form of project or team management.

<a name="scrumMaster"></a>
**Scrum Master -** Is not the team leader but is often viewed as the team coach who acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended, they have no authority over teammates, but due have complete authority over the process. A key part of their role is to protect the team and keep them focused on the *[tasks](#t)* at hand.

**Scrum of Scrums -** Is a scaling mechanism used to manage large projects involving multiple *[Scrum Teams](#scrumTeam)*. It is held to facilitate communication between teams that may have dependencies on one another. One member from each team attends the meeting in representation for the team, it can be either the Scrum Master or any member who can effectively relay information and handle questions or concerns for the team.

**Scrumban -** Is a hybrid of Scrum and *[Kanban](#k)* used to accomplish *[tasks](#t)* and produce deliverables.

**Spike -** A separate *[timebox](#timebox)* *[user story](#userStory)* or *[task](#t)* that is created in order to research a question or resolve a problem. A spike focuses on gathering information and providing an answer to a question.

<a name="sprint"></a>
**Sprint -** A sprint is fixed-length *[iterations](#iterations)* during which one *[user story](#userStory)* or *[product backlog item (PBI)](#pbi)* is transformed into a potentially shippable deliverable. Each sprint is assigned a set amount of time to be accomplished, which is usually between one week to one month.

**Sprint Backlog -** A sprint backlog is a segment of *[product backlog items (PBIs)](#pbi)* that the team selects to complete during a Scrum sprint.

**Sprint Planning Meeting -** Is a pre-sprint planning meeting attended by the core agile team. During the meeting the *[Product Owner](#productOwner)* describes the highest priority features to the team as described on the *[product backlog](#productBacklog)*. The team then agrees on the number of features they can accomplish in the sprint and plans out the *[tasks](#t)* required to achieve delivery of those features. The planning group works the features into User Stories and assigns Acceptance criteria to each story.

**Sprint Plan -** Is the tangible outcome of a Sprint Planning Meeting. The Sprint Plan is a written document assembled by the development team and includes the goal for the sprint and a detailed list of *[Product Backlog](#productBacklog)* Items or user stories the team has committed to completing by the end of the sprint, based on the teams availability and *[velocity](#v)*.

**Sprint Retrospective -** A meeting held following the completion of a sprint to discuss whether the sprint was successful and to identify improvements to be incorporated into the next sprint.

**Sprint Review -** The *[Scrum Team](#scrumTeam)* holds this meeting following the completion of a sprint to review and demonstrate what the team has accomplished during the sprint. This meeting is attended by the *[Product Owner](#productOwner)* or customer, *[Scrum Master](#scrumMaster)*, Scrum Team, and stakeholders. It is an informal meeting the length of which is determined by the length of the sprint, with one hour being equivalent to one week.

<a name="stakeholder"></a>
**Stakeholder -** Loosely refers to anyone outside the *[Scrum Team](#scrumTeam)* who has an interest in the product that the team is producing. Stakeholders can include but are not limited to direct managers, subject matter experts, account managers, salespeople, and legal officers.

<a name="storyPoints"></a>
**Story Points -** Non-unit of *[estimation](#estimation)* measuring complexity and size. Story points are relative, not absolute, and do not relate to actual hours.

**Story Mapping -** Refers to top-down visualization, or a roadmap, of *[product backlog](#productBacklog)*. It starts with a goal or specific functionality, which is then broken down into user stories.

**Swarming -** Is when team members with appropriate skills work together to complete a *[task](#t)* that a team member is having trouble completing on his or her own.

**Sustainable Pace -** Is the pace that an Agile team can work at indefinitely without resulting in developer burnout.

<a name="t"></a>
## T

**Task -** Is a single unit of work broken down from a *[user story](#userStory)*. Tasks are estimated in hours (or *[story points](#storyPoints)*) remaining by the developer working on them.

**Taskboard -** An Agile task board is a physical or online visual representation of user stories broken down into tasks or work units.

**Team/Team Member -** In an Agile, *[Scrum](#s)* or *[Kanban](#k)* environment, a teams is a small, highly functioning group of five to nine people who collaboratively work together to complete an *[iteration](#iterations)* or project. *[Scrum Teams](#scrumTeam)* are cross-functional; Kanban teams can be either cross-functional or specialist driven.

**Technical Debt -** Refers to the obligation a development team incurs when they use a short-term, expedient approach to developing software package without considering the long-term consequences. It increases project costs and complexity due to issues introduced through the software package.

<a name="tdd"></a>
**Test Driven Development (TDD) -** TDD is the practice of designing and building tests for functional, working code, and then building code that will pass those tests.

<a name="timebox"></a>
**Timebox -** Refers to an assigned period of time during which an individual or team work toward an established goal. The team stops work when the time period concludes, rather than when the work is completed. The Team then assesses how much work was accomplished toward the specified goal.

<a name="u"></a>
## U

**Unit Testing -** A unit test is a short program fragment written for testing and verifying a piece of code once it is completed. A piece of code either passes or fails the unit test.

**User Persona -** Personas are description of the typical end-users of a given software. A persona should include skills/background, goals/expectations, and other details pertinent to their being categorized as an end-user.

<a name="userStory"></a>
**User Stories -** A user story is a very high-level definition of a requirement written from the end-users point of view, containing just enough information so that the developers can produce a reasonable estimate of the effort to implement it.

<a name="v"></a>
## V

**Velocity -** It is a relative number which describes how much work the team can get done per *[sprint](#sprint)*.

**Vertical Slice -** Showing off a feature in a application that works from start to finish but may be limited in scope.

<a name="w"></a>
## W

**Work In Progress (WIP) -** Is any work that has been started but has yet to be completed.

<a name="x"></a>
## X

**XP -** A software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent “*[releases](#release)*” in short development cycles (*[timebox](#timebox)*), which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.
