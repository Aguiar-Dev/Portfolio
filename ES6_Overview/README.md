## Introduction

Welcome to the Overview on ECMAScript6, where I intend to showcase it's core features for you to apply in your projects. This Overview is meant to explain the core functionality behind ES6 and the features that are very often overlooked by us developers. My knowledge on ES6 at the start of this project was minimal at best, but during the process of research I have learned how it works and how to correctly apply it to my work.

I sincerely hope that this Overview can help shed some light on the ES6 features that are usually ignored. But more than that I hope that it is of help to you in your pursuit of learning ECMAScript6 and its secrets. Since this is meant to be an informative project I give full credit to the articles, guides, websites, videos and sources of information from where I collected all of the information. All of these resources can be found in the Resources Section.

## What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript, more commonly referred to ES, is a trademarked scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International. But it was developed originally by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name of Mocha, which was later changed to LiveScript and then finally JavaScript. It was announced in December 1995 and was subsequently released in March 1996 as Netscape Navigator, featuring support for JavaScript. Netscape eventually delivered JavaScript to Ecma International for standardization and this is where ECMAScript was born.

Being originally based off JavaScript, it became one of the main tools for JavaScript developers. Typically used in client-side scripting for websites and applications on the web, it has become one of the most utilized standards in the industry. Recently it has been picking up more fame by being used to script web based application with NodeJS. Now while many scripting languages like JavaScript aim to be compatible with ES, they all still deliver independent features which are not supported by the standards.
