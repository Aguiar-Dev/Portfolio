## Introduction

Welcome to the Overview on ECMAScript6, where I intend to showcase it's core features for you to apply in your projects. This Overview is meant to explain the core functionality behind ES6 and the features that are very often overlooked by us developers. My knowledge on ES6 at the start of this project was minimal at best, but during the process of research I have learned how it works and how to correctly apply it to my work.

I sincerely hope that this Overview can help shed some light on the ES6 features that are usually ignored. But more than that I hope that it is of help to you in your pursuit of learning ECMAScript6 and its secrets. Since this is meant to be an informative project I give full credit to the articles, guides, websites, videos and sources of information from where I collected all of the information. All of these resources can be found in the Resources Section.
