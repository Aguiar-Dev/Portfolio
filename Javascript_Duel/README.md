## Project Description

This is one of my first project at Full Sail University using simple Javascript, HTML and CSS structure. The purpose of the project was to practice simple javascript functionality by using DOM manipulation and modular functions. Please keep in mind this is an old project thus the code written is more simplistic than my current projects.

Since it was a individual project I modeled my character roster and game logic around the Injustice: Gods Among Us video game. I do not own the rights to the Injustice characters or the name, but simply utilized them for personal work recreation.
